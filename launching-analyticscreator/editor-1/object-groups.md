# Object groups

Object groups in AnalyticsCreator are a powerful feature that allows users to manage and organize objects such as sources, tables, and transformations efficiently.&#x20;

Groups can be used to filter displayed objects or to control workflow execution by including or excluding specific objects.

#### [**Object Membership**](object-membership.md)

Objects such as sources, tables, and transformations can be assigned to groups. These groups help to:

* Display only the objects belonging to a specific group.
* Enable or disable objects in the workflow based on their group membership.

#### [**Groups in the Navigation Tree**](groups-in-navigation-tree.md)

In the navigation tree, all defined groups are displayed with different icons for:

* Common groups.
* Workflow groups.

#### **Filtering the Diagram by Group**

To display only the objects belonging to a specific group in the diagram:

1. Use the **Group** dropdown in the menu bar.
2. Select the desired group to filter the diagram view.
