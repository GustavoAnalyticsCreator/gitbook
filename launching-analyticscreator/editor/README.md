# Launching AnalyticsCreator

### **After confirming your SQL Server connection, go back to the downloaded AnalyticsCreator installer**

Instead of selecting "Install," click "Launch" **(highlighted as "Number One" in the image below)**.&#x20;

This action will open a window displaying the AnalyticsCreator Servers, which will transmit the latest version of AnalyticsCreator to your system.

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Ask Dmitri if its possible to change it , to have just one button, or two buttons, launch and install , puttying launch first</mark>
