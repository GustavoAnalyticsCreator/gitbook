# Regular transformation

A regular transformation is a **VIEW** generated by AnalyticsCreator based on the defined transformation parameters. Tables, table relationships, and transformation columns must be specified, after which AnalyticsCreator automatically creates the transformation VIEW.

There is a typical regular transformation definition:

Regular transformation properties:&#x20;

1. Historizing type: defines how to work with historicized data.
   1. **FullHist**: A fully historicized transformation where the result includes the specific fields listed below. This type of transformation is commonly used for defining dimensions.
      1. &#x20;\[SATZ\_ID]
      2. \[DAT\_VON\_HIST]
      3. \[DAT\_BIS\_HIST] fields. Usually used to define dimensions.
   2. **SnapshotHist:** Fully historicized transformation with data for predefined snapshot dates only. Usually used to define dimensions.&#x20;
   3. **Snapshot:** Transformation using predefined snapshot dates to combine historicized data. Usually used to define facts.
   4. **ActualOnly:** To combine historicized data only actual data will be used. Can be used to create dimensions and facts.
   5. **None:** Should be used to work with not historicized data.&#x20;
2. Create unknown member: usually used in dimensions. Adds to the transformation a new row with surrogate ID = 0 and default values for the fields. Usually is used as a dimension member in case the according dimension member is not found during the fact processing.
3. Fact transformation: should be checked for fact transformations&#x20;
4. Persist table: name of the table to persist transformation results.&#x20;
5. Persist package: name of the SSIS package to persist transformation results Result table: Relevant for external or script transformations. The name of the table where the transformation result will be stored
6. SSIS Package: Relevant for external or script transformations. The name of the SSIS package where the transformation will be launched&#x20;
7. Hub of table: Read only. Source table for hub transformations&#x20;
8. Sat of table: Read only. Source table for satellite transformations&#x20;
9. Link of table: Read only. Source table for link transformations&#x20;
10. Snapshots: List of snapshots and snapshot groups used in transformation. Relevant for historizing type Snapshot and SnapshotHist only.&#x20;
11. Tables: List of tables participating in the transformation&#x20;
    1. **SeqNr:** sequential number. Should be unique for each table.&#x20;
    2. **Table:** table name Table Alias: Alias of the table. Should be unique. Used in column and reference statements&#x20;
    3. **JoinHistType:** how the historical table should be joined&#x20;
       1. None – the table doesn’t contain historical data&#x20;
       2. Actual – only the actual data from the historical table will be used&#x20;
       3. Historical\_from – the data which were valid on the start of the guilty period of the linked record
       4. Historical\_to – the data which were valid on the end of the guilty period of the linked record
       5. Full – whole historicizing information remains available.&#x20;
    4. **Join type:**&#x20;
       1. INNER JOIN
       2. LEFT JOIN
       3. RIGHT JOIN
       4. FULL JOIN or CROSS JOIN&#x20;
    5. Force join: force specific join type: LOOP JOIN, HASH JOIN, MERGE JOIN&#x20;
    6. Reference statement: Here the user can refine or redefine the reference statement used for join, for example:

```sql
T5.ID = T1.CustomerID 
```

12. Filter statement: statement used additionally to reference statement, for example:

```sql
T5.Country = ‘GER’ 
```

13. Sub select: sub select statement used additionally to reference statement&#x20;
14. Columns: List of transformation columns&#x20;
    1. **Column name:** column name&#x20;
    2. **TableSeqNr:** optional. Table sequence number (from Tables – table)&#x20;
    3. **Reference:** optional. Table column from the table above&#x20;
    4. **Statement:** optional. SQL Statement (table aliases should be used)&#x20;
    5. **IsAggr:** should be checked for aggregated fields Default value: field value for unknown members&#x20;
    6. **SeqNr:** column sequential number&#x20;
    7. **PK Position:** field position in primary key (1,2…)&#x20;
    8. **Description:** field description&#x20;
15. References: table reference used to join transformation tables (see table references)&#x20;
    1. **SeqNr1**: Sequence number of the first table&#x20;
    2. **SeqNr2:** Sequence number of the second table&#x20;
    3. Reference: reference name&#x20;
16. Predefined transformations: list of predefined transformations used in transformation&#x20;
17. **VIEW tab:** contains the VIEW definition. Is read only&#x20;

Transformation can be compiled. Press “compile” button. In this case the transformation view will be compiled and errors will be detected. Transformation can be created. Press “create” button. In this case the transformation view will be created in the empty DWH and errors will be detected.
