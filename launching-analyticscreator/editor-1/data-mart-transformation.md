# Data mart transformation

Data mart transformations are the views created in data mart layer. You cannot create data mart transformation manually – instead you should define the “Stars” – affiliation of the other transformation – and according data mart transformations will be created automatically:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Every regular or manual transformation can be persisted – the content of VIEW can be stored in a table.
