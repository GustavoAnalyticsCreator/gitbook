# SSIS Packages

SSIS packages are automatically generated by AnalyticsCreator as part of the deployment process. These packages are used to execute ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes within the data warehouse, depending on the architecture and requirements.

#### **Types of SSIS Packages**

1. [**Import Packages**](import-package.md)
   * These packages are used to import data from external sources into the data warehouse.
2. [**Historization Packages**](historization-package.md)
   * These handle the historicization of data, ensuring changes are tracked over time for analytical purposes.
3. [**Persisting Packages**](persisting-package.md)
   * These packages are responsible for persisting transformation results within the data warehouse.
4. [**Script Launching Packages**](script-launching-package.md)
   * These are designed to execute script-based transformations.
5. [**Workflow Packages**](workflow-package.md)
   * These orchestrate the execution of all other packages in the correct sequence, ensuring that ETL or ELT processes are performed in a logical and efficient order.

Each package type is tailored to specific tasks, enabling seamless integration and efficient data processing in the data warehouse environment. AnalyticsCreator simplifies the configuration and generation of these packages, providing a robust and automated ETL solution.
