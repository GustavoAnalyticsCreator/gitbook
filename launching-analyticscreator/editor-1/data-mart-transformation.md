# Data mart transformation

Data mart transformations are views created in the data mart layer. A data mart transformation cannot be created manually. Instead, the "Stars" – the affiliation of other transformations – must be defined, and the corresponding data mart transformations will be created automatically

Every regular or manual transformation can be persisted. The content of the VIEW can be stored in a table.
