# Layers detailed

AnalyticsCreator empowers users to define and customize layers within their Data Warehouse projects, offering flexibility to align with popular methodologies and architectures. Layers serve as the foundation for organizing and transforming data throughout its lifecycle, from raw ingestion to final reporting and analytics.

### Supported Methodologies and Architectures

#### [**1. Kimball Methodology**](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/)

* Focused on **dimensional modeling**, this methodology organizes data into fact and dimension tables.
* Layers can represent stages such as **staging**, **transformation**, and **presentation**, ensuring a streamlined ETL process.
* Enables fast query performance, designed for business intelligence and reporting.

#### [**2. Medallion Architecture**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-medallion-architecture/2-describe-medallion-architecture)

* Based on a **tiered structure** to process and refine data progressively:
  * **Bronze Layer**: Raw, unprocessed data ingestion.
  * **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data ready for analysis.
  * **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and optimized data for business reporting.
* Facilitates incremental data processing and ensures clear data lineage.

#### [**3. Data Vault 2.0**](https://datavaultalliance.com/data-vault-2-0-model/)

* Aimed at **flexible and scalable modeling** for large-scale data integration.
* Layers typically include:
  * **Raw Vault**: Ingested data in its raw, immutable form.
  * **Business Vault**: Applied business rules for enriched and transformed data.
  * **Information Mart**: Data structured for specific reporting needs.
* Supports agile development with a focus on historical tracking and auditability.
