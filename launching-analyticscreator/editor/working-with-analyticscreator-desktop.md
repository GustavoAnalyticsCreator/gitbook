# Working with AnalyticsCreator Desktop

#### **Basic Operations in AnalyticsCreator Desktop**

Understanding the fundamental operations in AnalyticsCreator Desktop is essential for efficiently managing your data warehouse repository and ensuring accuracy in your projects. Below are key basic operations you can perform within the interface:

### Edit mode and saving - Data Warehouse editor <a href="#toc_0" id="toc_0"></a>

* **Single Object Editing**: In the Data Warehouse Repository, you can edit one object at a time. This ensures precision and reduces the risk of unintended changes across multiple objects.
* **How to Edit**: Double-click on any field within an object to enter edit mode. The selected field becomes editable, allowing you to make modifications.
* **Save Prompt**: If any changes are made, a prompt will appear, reminding you to save your modifications before exiting the edit mode. This safeguard prevents accidental loss of changes.
* **Unsaved Changes**: While edits are immediately reflected in the repository interface, they are not permanently saved until explicitly confirmed by clicking the **Save** button.

#### **Accessing Views in Data Warehouse Explorer**

* **Layer-Specific Views**: Each layer in the data warehouse contains views generated by AnalyticsCreator. These views provide insights into the underlying data structure and transformations applied at that layer.
* **How to Access**: To access the views, simply navigate to the **Data Warehouse Explorer** and click on the **View** tab for the desired layer. This action displays the layerâ€™s contents, including tables, fields, and transformations.

***

#### **Adding and Deleting Objects**

1. **Adding New Objects**:
   * Navigate to the appropriate section (e.g., Tables, Layers, or Connectors) in the **navigation tree**.
   * Right-click and select **Add \[Object Type]** to create a new object.
   * Provide the necessary details, such as name, description, and configuration parameters, and then save the object.
2. **Deleting Objects**:
   * Select the object in the **navigation tree** and right-click to choose **Delete**.
   * Confirm the deletion when prompted. Note that deleting an object may affect dependent objects or configurations.

***

#### **Filtering and Searching in Data Warehouse Explorer**

* **Filtering**: Use filters to narrow down the displayed objects based on specific criteria, such as object name, type, or creation date.
* **Searching**: Enter keywords or phrases in the search bar to quickly locate objects within the repository.
* **Benefits**: These features help manage large repositories by focusing on the most relevant objects, improving efficiency.

***

#### **Object Dependencies and Relationships**

* **Dependency View**: For any selected object, view its dependencies and relationships with other objects by accessing the **Dependencies** tab.
* **Impact Analysis**: Use the dependency view to analyze how changes to one object might affect other parts of the data warehouse.

***

#### **Managing Scripts**

* **Predefined Scripts**: Add predefined scripts for commonly used operations, such as data transformations or custom SQL queries.
* **Edit and Run**: Modify scripts by double-clicking them in the navigation tree. Use the **Run Script** option to execute scripts and view the results.

***

#### **Validating and Testing Changes**

* **Validation Tools**: Use the built-in validation tools to check for errors or inconsistencies in your repository.
* **Evaluate Changes**: Before saving edits or deploying updates, use the **Evaluate** button to test the functionality and ensure correctness.

***

#### **Locking and Unlocking Objects**

* **Locking**: Prevent simultaneous edits by locking objects. This is especially useful in collaborative environments.
* **Unlocking**: Release locks when edits are complete to allow others to make modifications.

***

#### **Exporting and Importing Data**

1. **Export**:
   * Export objects, scripts, or configurations from the repository for sharing or backup purposes.
   * Use the **Export** option in the toolbar or navigation tree.
2. **Import**:
   * Import previously exported files to quickly replicate configurations or restore backups.
   * Use the **Import** option and follow the prompts to load the data.
