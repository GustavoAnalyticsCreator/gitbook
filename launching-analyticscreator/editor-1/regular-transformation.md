# Regular transformation

**Regular Transformation**&#x20;

A regular transformation is a **VIEW** generated by AnalyticsCreator based on the defined transformation parameters. Tables, table relationships, and transformation columns must be specified, after which AnalyticsCreator automatically creates the transformation **VIEW**.

Below is a typical regular transformation definition:

Regular transformation properties:&#x20;

1. **Historization type:  D**efines how to work with historicized data.
   1. **FullHist**: A fully historicized transformation where the result includes specific fields. This type is commonly used for defining dimensions. Fields:
      1. \[SATZ\_ID]
      2. \[DAT\_VON\_HIST]
      3. \[DAT\_BIS\_HIST] fields. Usually used to define dimensions.
   2. **SnapshotHist:** Fully historicized transformation with data for predefined snapshot dates only. This type is usually used to define dimensions.
   3. **Snapshot:** A transformation that uses predefined snapshot dates to combine historicized data. It is usually used to define facts.
   4. **ActualOnly:** Combines historicized data, but only actual data is used. This can be used to create dimensions and facts.
   5. **None:** Used to work with non-historicized data
2. **Create unknown member:** Usually used in dimensions. This option adds a new row with a surrogate ID = 0 and default values for the fields. It is used as a dimension member when the corresponding dimension member is not found during fact processing.
3. **Fact transformation:** This option should be selected for fact transformations.
4. **Persist table:** The name of the table where the transformation results will be stored.
5. **Persist package:** The name of the SSIS package used to persist the transformation results.
6. **SSIS Package:** Relevant for external or script transformations. This is the name of the SSIS package that launches the transformation.
7. **Hub of table:** Read-only. The source table for hub transformations.
8. **Sat of table:** The source table for satellite transformations.
9. **Link of table:** Read-only. The source table for link transformations.
10. **Snapshots:** A list of snapshots and snapshot groups used in the transformation. This is relevant only for historization types **Snapshot** and **SnapshotHist**.
11. **Tables:** A list of tables participating in the transformation.
    1. **SeqNr:** A sequential number that should be unique for each table.
    2. **Table:** The name of the table.
    3. **Table Alias**: The alias of the table. It should be unique and is used in column and reference statements.
    4. **JoinHistType:** Defines how the historical table should be joined.&#x20;
       1. None – The table doesn’t contain historical data.
       2. Actual – Only the actual data from the historical table will be used.
       3. Historical\_from – The data that was valid at the start of the "guilty" period of the linked record.
       4. Historical\_to –The data that was valid at the end of the "guilty" period of the linked record.
       5. Full – All historicizing information remains available.
    5. **Join type:**&#x20;
       1. INNER JOIN
       2. LEFT JOIN
       3. RIGHT JOIN
       4. FULL JOIN or CROSS JOIN&#x20;
    6. **Force Join**: Forces a specific join type:
       1. &#x20;LOOP JOIN
       2. &#x20;HASH JOIN
       3. &#x20;MERGE JOIN&#x20;
    7. Reference statement: Here the user can refine or redefine the reference statement used for join, for example:

```sql
T5.ID = T1.CustomerID 
```

12. **A filter statement:** is an additional statement used alongside the reference statement. For example:

```sql
T5.Country = ‘GER’ 
```

13. **Sub select:** A subselect statement is used in addition to the reference statement.
14. **Columns:** List of transformation columns&#x20;
    1. **Column name:** The name of the column.
    2. **TableSeqNr:** Optional. The table sequence number (from the **Tables** section).
    3. **Reference:** Optional. The table column from the table above.
    4. **Statement:** Optional. The SQL statement (table aliases should be used).
    5. **IsAggr:**&#x54;his should be checked for aggregated fields.Default value: The field value for unknown members.
    6. **SeqNr:** The column’s sequential number.&#x20;
    7. **PK Position:** The field position in the primary key (1, 2, etc.).
    8. **Description:** A description of the field.&#x20;
15. **References:** The table reference used to join transformation tables (see **Table References**).
    1. **SeqNr1**: The sequence number of the first table.
    2. **SeqNr2:** The sequence number of the second table.&#x20;
    3. Reference: The reference name.
16. **Predefined transformations:** A list of predefined transformations used in the transformation.
17. **VIEW tab:** Contains the **VIEW** definition. It is read-only.

**Transformation Compilation and Creation**

* **Compile**: The transformation can be compiled by pressing the **"Compile"** button. In this case, the transformation **VIEW** will be compiled, and any errors will be detected.
* **Create**: The transformation can be created by pressing the **"Create"** button. In this case, the transformation **VIEW** will be created in the empty DWH, and errors will be detected.
